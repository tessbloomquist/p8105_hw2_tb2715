\#\#\#Problem 1

\#Load and clean trash wheel 2019
data

``` r
trash_wheel_2019 = read_excel(path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                         skip = 1)
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...15
    ## * `` -> ...16
    ## * `` -> ...17

``` r
tidy_trash_wheel =
  janitor::clean_names(trash_wheel_2019) %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  select(-x15, -x16, -x17) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)) 

tidy_trash_wheel_17 = 
  filter(tidy_trash_wheel, year == '2017')
```

\#Read in precipitation
data

``` r
precipitation_18 = read_excel(path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "2018 Precipitation", 
  skip = 1,
  col_names = TRUE) %>%
  drop_na(Month, Total) %>%
  mutate(Year = "2018")


precipitation_17 = read_excel(path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "2017 Precipitation", 
  skip = 1,
  col_names = TRUE) %>%
  drop_na(Month, Total) %>%
  mutate(Year = "2017")
```

\#Merge precipitation data

``` r
precipitation_data_test = 
  bind_rows(precipitation_18, precipitation_17) %>%
  mutate(Month = month.name[Month])
```

After cleaning the trashwheel data set, the tidy trashwheel data
contains 344 rows and 14 columns. The columns consist of information
collected from the site. Notably, some of these variables are :

`date` = date of trash collection `dumpster` = specific dumpster
`sports_balls` = the number of sports balls collected in Mr. Trashwheel
on the given date rounded to the nearest integer. The median number of
sports balls in the dumpster in 2017 is 8. `weight_tons` = the weight of
trash in tons collected by Mr. Trashwheel on the given date

After combining and cleaning the precipitation data set, it contains 24
rows and 3 columns.The columns are specific for:

`Month`= month of precipitation measurement `Total` = total
precipitation for a given month in specified year `Year` = year of
precipitation measurement

The total precipitation measured in 2018 is 70.33 \`

\#merge data sets

``` r
snp_pols_merge =

merge_385 = 
  left_join(snp_pols_merge, tidy_unemployment_data, by = c("year","month"))
```

The data set “pols-data” contains 822 observations of 9 variables
related to the number of national politicians who are democratic or
republican at any given time. The “snp” data contains 787 observations
of 3 variables related to Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S\&P),
often used as a representative measure of stock market as a whole. The
“unemployment” dataset contains 816 observations of 3 variables
outlining the percentage of unemployment in a given month and year.

The merge 385 data set, containing all of the above data merged based on
date allows us to compare presidental party power with social/economic
outcomes such as unemployment and stocks. The merged data contains 822
observations of 11

month: date of the count gov\_gop: the number of republican governors on
the associated date sen\_gop: the number of republican senators on the
associated date rep\_gop: the number of republican representatives on
the associated date gov\_dem: the number of democratic governors on the
associated date sen\_dem: the number of democratic senators on the
associated date rep\_dem: the number of democratic representatives on
the associated date president: indicator of whether the president was a
republican or democrat close: the closing values of the S\&P stock index
on the associated date unemployed: percentage of unemployment in January
of the associated year

use in scatterplot below
